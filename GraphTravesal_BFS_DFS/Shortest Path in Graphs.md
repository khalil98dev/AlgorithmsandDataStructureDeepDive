# Overview

The shortest path problem is a fundamental concept in graph theory. It involves finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## What is the Shortest Path Problem?

The shortest path problem seeks to find the **minimum-cost** path between two nodes in a graph. Common applications include:

- GPS navigation systems.
- Network routing.
- Game development (pathfinding for characters).

### Types of Shortest Path Algorithms:

- **Single-source shortest path:** Finds paths from one node to all others (e.g., Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- **All-pairs shortest path:** Finds paths between every pair of nodes (e.g., Floyd-Warshall).
